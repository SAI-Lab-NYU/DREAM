## Setup & Installation


```bash
cd DREAM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference
The inference code we provide automatically allocates model weights (loading a model across multiple GPUs), allowing you to run models that exceed the memory of a single GPU.

### With UI
We have provided a suggested web interface, which you can use by running the following command. After the model is fully loaded, a URL will be output in the terminal, which you can enter into your browser to access.
```bash
python -m dream.application.webui --ea-model-path /home/apc/models/DREAM-Vicuna-7B-v1.3 --base-model-path /home/apc/models/vicuna-7b-v1.3 --model-type vicuna --total-token 8
```
The *total-token* is the number of draft tokens. For smaller models and advanced GPUs, this value can be set larger. Adjusting according to the specific device and model can achieve better results. If set to -1, DREAM will automatically configure this parameter.


## Train

### Generate Train Data
You can run the following command to generate the training data.
```bash
python -m dream.ge_data.allocation --outdir [path of data]
```
### Train the Auto-regression Head

```bash
cd dream/model
deepspeed main_deepspeed.py --deepspeed_config /home/apc/DREAM/dream/train/ds_config.json --tmpdir /home/apc/Bingle/data/llava_vicuna_mmt_0/12_data/sharegpt_0_7999_mufp16 --cpdir /home/apc/DREAM/dream/train/vicuna-7b-ckpt --configpath /home/apc/DREAM/dream/train/vicuna_7B_config.json
```

## Evaluation
You can test the speed of DREAM on MT-bench using the following command.
```bash
python -m dream.evaluation.eval_llava\
		 --ea-model-path [path of DREAM weight]\ 
		 --base-model-path [path of the original model]\
```
The above two commands will each generate a .jsonl file that records the generation results and wall time.

This project has been influenced by many excellent projects in the LLM community, such as [Medusa](https://github.com/FasterDecoding/Medusa), [EAGLE](https://github.com/SafeAILab/EAGLE), [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), and others. We first release LLaVA version, others will merge together soon.
